#summary Feedback-driven fuzzing in honggfuzz

= Feedback-driven fuzzing =
Honggfuzz is capable of performing feedback-driven fuzzing. It utilizes Linux perf subsystem and hardware CPU counters to achieve that

= Requirements =
   * GNU/Linux OS
   * Relatively modern Linux kernel (v 3.2 should suffice)
   * A CPU which is supported by the [https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page perf subsystem] for instruction and branch counting-driven fuzzing
   * A CPU supporting [https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/277868?language=es BTS (Branch Trace Store)]. Currently it's available in some newer Intel CPUs (unfortunately no AMD support for now)

= Examples =
The main fuzzing strategy is quite simple. It tries to maximize the number of perf events while mangling the file which servers as an unput for fuzzing.

It will start with some initial file (or with no file at all), and subsequent fuzzing iterations will try to maximize the number of instructions spent on parsing it.
