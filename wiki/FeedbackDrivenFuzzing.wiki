#summary Feedback-driven fuzzing in honggfuzz

= Feedback-driven fuzzing =
Honggfuzz is capable of performing feedback-driven fuzzing. It utilizes Linux perf subsystem and hardware CPU counters to achieve that

= Requirements =
   * GNU/Linux OS
   * Relatively modern Linux kernel (v 3.2 should suffice)
   * A CPU which is supported by the [https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page perf subsystem] for instruction and branch counting-driven fuzzing
   * A CPU supporting [https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/277868?language=es BTS (Branch Trace Store)]. Currently it's available in some newer Intel CPUs (unfortunately no AMD support for now)
